# ðŸ”§ Fix for 404 Issue

## Problem Found!

Your tenants exist (âœ… `retiro` and `try` are in database), but the **middleware was incorrectly extracting subdomains** from regular URLs.

---

## What Was Wrong

When you visited:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/retiro/menu
```

The middleware was:
1. Extracting `your-app` as a "subdomain" (wrong!)
2. Trying to rewrite `/retiro/menu` to something broken
3. Resulting in 404

---

## The Fix

I've updated `src/lib/tenant.ts` to **only extract subdomains when explicitly configured**.

### New Logic:

```typescript
// OLD (broken):
// If no root domain, extract first part of hostname
const generic = hostNoPort.split('.')[0]
return RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS.has(generic) ? null : generic

// NEW (fixed):
// Only extract subdomains when PLATFORM_ROOT_DOMAIN is set
return null
```

---

## Now It Works Like This

### Without Custom Domain (Vercel URL):

```
Visit: your-app.vercel.app/retiro/menu
       â†“
Middleware: No subdomain configured â†’ Skip subdomain extraction
       â†“
Route normally to: /[tenant]/menu/page.tsx
       â†“
âœ… Works!
```

### With Custom Domain (After Setup):

```
Visit: retiro.yourdomain.com
       â†“
Middleware: Has PLATFORM_ROOT_DOMAIN â†’ Extract "retiro"
       â†“
Rewrite to: /retiro/menu
       â†“
Route to: /[tenant]/menu/page.tsx
       â†“
âœ… Works!
```

## Test It Now

### On Vercel (Path-Based):

```bash
# These should work now:
https://your-app.vercel.app/retiro/menu
https://your-app.vercel.app/try/menu
```

### On Local (Subdomain):

```bash
# These still work:
http://retiro.localhost:3000
http://try.localhost:3000
```

## Next: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix middleware subdomain extraction logic"
   git push
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-deploy**

3. **Test the URLs above**

---

## For Subdomain Support Later

When you want `retiro.yourdomain.com` to work:

1. **Buy a domain**
2. **Add to Vercel** (Settings â†’ Domains)
3. **Configure DNS** (add wildcard A record)
4. **Add environment variable:**
   ```
   PLATFORM_ROOT_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
   ```
5. **Redeploy**

Then subdomains will work automatically!

---

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed**: Middleware no longer incorrectly extracts subdomains
âœ… **Works**: Path-based URLs work on any domain
âœ… **Ready**: Can enable subdomain support when you have custom domain

Deploy and test!
